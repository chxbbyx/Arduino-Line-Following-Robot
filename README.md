# Arduino-Line-Following-Robot
 This project introduces an innovative Arduino-based line following robot, meticulously designed for the streamlined transportation of goods within factories or similar environments.
The robot employs infrared sensors to adeptly trace a predefined path on the ground, ensuring swift and precise navigation. Notably, the robot is equipped with an intelligent alarm system that triggers when goods are missing during the transportation process.

Key Features
* Line Following: The robot utilizes infrared sensors to accurately follow a marked path, facilitating efficient movement within a designated area.

* Goods Transportation: Tailored specifically for transporting goods, this robot enhances operational efficiency in factories by automating the logistics process.

* Quick and Precise Navigation: Engineered for speed and precision, the robot swiftly navigates along the predefined path, optimizing the transportation workflow.

* Missing Goods Alarm: In the event of missing goods, the robot intelligently halts its operation and activates an alarm system, promptly alerting operators to take necessary action.
